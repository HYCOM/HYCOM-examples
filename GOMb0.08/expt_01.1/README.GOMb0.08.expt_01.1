1)    How to turn on the nest options in HYCOM

Nesting options are turn on by setting the blkdat variable lbflag to 2 
(Browning & Kreiss) or 4 (Flather) and the time frequency to update the 
nest is handled by 2 blkdat input variables, 'bnstfq' and 'nestfq', set 
in our examples to -30.5 for monthly mean archive files, see 
GOMb0.08/expt_01.1/blkdat.input

  -30.5   'bnstfq' = number of days between baro nesting archive input
  -30.5   'nestfq' = number of days between 3-d  nesting archive input
â€¦
      2      'lbflag' = lateral barotropic bndy flag (0=none, 1=port, 2=input)


2)    How to set the location of the open-boundaries

The location of barotropic boundaries must be specified in the file 
GOMb0.08/expt_01.1/ports.input.  

  1.1   'sports' = scale factor for nested velocity (typically 1.0)
  6     'nports' = number of boundary port sections
  3     'kdport' = port orientation (1=N, 2=S, 3=E, 4=W)
251     'ifport' = first i-index
251     'ilport' = last  i-index (=ifport for east/west port)
105     'jfport' = first j-index
116     'jlport' = last  j-index (=jfport for north/south port)
  2     'kdport' = port orientation (1=N, 2=S, 3=E, 4=W)
129     'ifport' = first i-index
246     'ilport' = last  i-index (=ifport for east/west port)
  2     'jfport' = first j-index
  2     'jlport' = last  j-index (=jfport for north/south port)
  3     'kdport' = port orientation (1=N, 2=S, 3=E, 4=W)
262     'ifport' = first i-index
262     'ilport' = last  i-index (=ifport for east/west port)
  6     'jfport' = first j-index
 24     'jlport' = last  j-index (=jfport for north/south port)
  3     'kdport' = port orientation (1=N, 2=S, 3=E, 4=W)
251     'ifport' = first i-index
251     'ilport' = last  i-index (=ifport for east/west port)
 60     'jfport' = first j-index
 84     'jlport' = last  j-index (=jfport for north/south port)
  3     'kdport' = port orientation (1=N, 2=S, 3=E, 4=W)
262     'ifport' = first i-index
262     'ilport' = last  i-index (=ifport for east/west port)
121     'jfport' = first j-index
192     'jlport' = last  j-index (=jfport for north/south port)
  1     'kdport' = port orientation (1=N, 2=S, 3=E, 4=W)
226     'ifport' = first i-index
261     'ilport' = last  i-index (=ifport for east/west port)
193     'jfport' = first j-index
193     'jlport' = last  j-index (=jfport for north/south port)

The 1st line is sports, which specifies a scale factor to be applied to the 
barotropic velocity on the open boundary.  It is optional (not present in most 
existing ports.input files), with a default of 1.0 (no scaling). We are using 1.1 
to get better agreement with Florida Current observed transport. This is for 6 
open boundaries, 1 in the northern, 1 in the southern and 4 in the eastern edge 
of the region rectangle.  These were initially positioned based on  
GOMb0.08/datasets/topo/depth_GOMb0.08_07_map.log.  However this is showing the 
p-grid (cell centers) but northern and southern boundaries are actually specified 
on the v-grid (since v-velocity is normal to these boundaries), and similarly eastern 
and western boundaries are specified on the u-grid.  Each boundary location is a 
grid point just outside the model region.  Correctly positioned open boundaries 
appear as *'s on the iu and iv maps printed in the model run .log file. You can also 
check their position by running GOMb0.08/ports/011/ports_map.csh (Note that the 011 
corresponds to the experiment number).  If the boundary locations are mis-specified 
the model will stop and the iu and/or iv maps will contain 9's instead of *'s at the 
locations that are in error.  Some errors (e.g. boundaries that are too short) can't 
be detected by HYCOM, so always check the iu and iv maps when initially configuring 
a nested domain.

Note that the nesting buffer zone relaxation is completely independent of climatology buffer zone relaxation.  Both could be active in the same model run.  Nesting barotropic boundary conditions cannot be used in combination with port (lbflag=1), specified inflow/outflow forcing.
