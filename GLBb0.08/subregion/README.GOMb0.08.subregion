In this examples, the nest files are created from the monthly global HYCOM reanalysis
(https://www.hycom.org/dataserver/gofs-3pt1/reanalysis) files available on the HYCOM 
server (see ~/HYCOM-examples/datasets/get_datasets.csh) and necessitate the grid and 
bathymetry of GLBb0.08; see ~/HYCOM-examples/GLBb0.08/datasets/get_datasets.csh).

If you do not want to re-create the nest files, download them directly at:

The GOMb0.08 configuration is a sub-region of GLBb0.08 at the same resolution, and this 
section illustrates how to nest a subregion in a larger HYCOM model region (Note that 
this example is also valid for nesting to any finer horizontal resolution). 

The GOMb0.08 HYCOM model does not "know" about the GLBb0.08 domain. It expects a sequence 
of GOMb0.08  input archive files to supply the data needed for the boundary conditions.  
In fact, there are two distinct sets of boundary conditions: 
a) relaxation to T/S/p/u/v in a buffer zone, and  b) application of depth averaged flow 
at the open boundary. Both are input from archive files, however T/S/p/u/v is only 
available from full 3-D archive files and depth averaged flow is also available from 
surface archive files. So, archive input for depth averaged flow could be more frequent 
than for T/S/p/u/v.

The nested domain must be (the same resolution as or) finer than the original. Don't forget 
to allow for the fact that the buffer zone (typically at least 10 coarse grid points 
defined by relax/010/nest_rmu.[ab]) should probably be outside the region of high interest.

To facilitate the interpolation from the coarser to the finer domain, we first create an 
index map file between the 2 domains. In ~HYCOM-examples/GLBb0.08/subregion, edit gmapi.csh 
and produce GOMb0.08/datasets/topo/regional.gmapi_GLBb0.08.[ab]. 
Then create the monthly nest files interpolated on the sub-region grid by editing the 
different paths of nest.csh and running it. Note that the bathymetry used to produce the 
nest files is the one with the same mask as GLBb0.08 over the region (i.e. 
depth_gomb0.08_09m11s.[ab]). You should now have 12 nest files in your scratch: 
GOMb0.08/datasets/subregion/archm.1994_??_2015_??.[ab]
To be recognized by HYCOM, these files will be copied in your scratch 
GOMb0.08/expt_01.1/data/nest and renamed by GOMb0.08/expt_01.1/011_nest_link.csh in 
GOMb0.08/expt_01.1/011.csh to fit the time period you are running.
